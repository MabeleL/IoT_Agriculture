# IoT_Agriculture

This code is for Limabora project. Limabora is a project for smart farming using a DHT and a soil moisture sensor to collect temperature,
humidity and soil moisture data from a greenhouse.

The solution uses LoRa technology to transmit the data from the sensors using an RN2483 module and the ATmega328P MCU. This code ha been written
with C++ using Platformio.

The sensor data is then transmitted to thethingsnetwork platform.
