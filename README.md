This code is used to test the reliability that Long Range Radio (LoRa) technology can
give in trying to transmit data from greenhouse farm environments to real-time cloud and finally
to an android mobile application that a farmer can use to see real-time data about their farm
environment from anywhere. These data include the humidity, temperature and the soil
moisture of the farm transmitted in real-time to an Android mobile application through
Googleâ€™s firebase.
